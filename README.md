# React Form Example with usage of React Hook Form, Typescript, zod and interationalization

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Disclaimer

Main goal of this repository is to provide a backbone for setting up React Hook Form with several enhancements such as typescript, zod resolvers, error message translation. Styling was reduced to a bare minimum.

## Stack

### `Typescript`

Ensures type safety in terms of provided data

### `zod`

Great library to create resolvers that can be used with React Hook Form, apply restrictions and keep an eye on the shape of our actual data

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
